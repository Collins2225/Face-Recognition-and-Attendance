This project demonstrates a simple face‑recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library. 
It loads a reference image of Elon Musk and compares it with a test image by detecting faces, extracting facial encodings, 
and calculating the similarity between them. The script draws bounding boxes around detected faces, displays the comparison result, 
and shows both images in OpenCV windows.
